Seeing what ways Louise can start campaigns successfully

## Written Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
  The purpose of this challenge was to help guid Louise to understand why different campaigns succeeded or failed based off when they launched and how they were funded. 
### Challeneges posed by this analysis
  There are a few hiccups I came across while performing this study. It was intersting how I analyzed how different levels of pay affected how successful startups became. The same can be said for startups that failed. It seems as if many startups were successful when funded up to one-thousand dollars. It took me quite some time to figure out the COUNTIFS statements, but I was finally able to visit some office hours in order to get some help. 
#### Questions
  There are quite a bit of conclusions that one can infer from 'Outcomes Based on Launch Date'. However, there are two that I will highlight in particular.
    1. The data proves to explain that startup campaigns were most successful in the months, May and June. For instance, in May there were one-hundred and eleven successful startups and the same can be said for the one-hundred startups in June. From this we can infer that people enjoy viewing plays or funding for them in the summertime. 
    2. Another conclusion that one can find is that in the month of October. It seems that although there weren't an abnormal amount of startups, the balance between failed and successful were relatively close. In October, there were 50 failed and 65 successful satrtups. 
##### Conclusion via 'Outcomes Based on Goals'
One conclusion that I was able to conclude is that the most successful campaigns were funded from $10,000-$14999. The Percentage of successful to failed campaigns were 91.14% to 8.86%. You can find this in the sheet labeled 'Outcomes based on Goals'. 
###### Limitations of the Data Set
  I was able to locate a few limitations from the data set. A)Limiting the category of startups to Plays. This allowed the data to be finite, but there were many other programs successful or failed. B) Issues related to filtering the data set in to correct funding amounts. I think that this was not necessarily the most accurate test considering funded is one thing, but being backed and having strong donations could be something else to consider.
###### Other possible graphs or tables
  I Think a bar graph would suffice. This is especially evident when you are looking at the funded portion of each campaign. Another graph we could look at is a different line chart.
